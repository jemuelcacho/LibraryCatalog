# Project Name
LibraryCatalog

# Description
This project is to ensure that the Library has the easiest but also can ensure that the Users are onpoint with there payments.
Neverthless, the library would not have a difficult time to check the availability of a book, register checked out, register as returned, etc.
At the end, you can get a report of all the books that are currently checked out, the quantity of books for each genre, and how much is owed
by each user. In short words, this program will give you full control of the catalog and you it would be up to date.

Later on you will see how I made each method for this project including details of why I made such decisions.
